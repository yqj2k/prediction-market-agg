^Error with uvicorn fast-api download [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75684738/not-able-to-run-fastapi-server-valueerror-source-code-string-cannot-contain-nu)

## run server
`make local venv env-pymongo-polymarket-crud`
`python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`


## Order of operations
- Query markets endpoint. Markets contain the odds
- take events metadata (ie. slug, description). Slug contains URL of the single event

## Get slug from event to polymarket URL:
- take slug from event data (ie. 'superbowl-champion-2025' )
- URL is polymarket.com/event/{slug}

## problems
- Create DB entry works, but returns error 500
